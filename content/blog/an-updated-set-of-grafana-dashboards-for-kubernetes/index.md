## Introduction

Two years ago, I published [A set of modern Grafana dashboards for Kubernetes](https://0xdc.me/blog/a-set-of-modern-grafana-dashboards-for-kubernetes/) to share the dashboards I created for Kubernetes with the community. In this article, I'll provide an update on the project and walk through the main changes that have been made since then.

## Project's updates

The [dotdc/grafana-dashboards-kubernetes](https://github.com/dotdc/grafana-dashboards-kubernetes) project has evolved significantly over the last two years! Following several retweets, both the original article and the project saw a noticeable increase in traffic, which also brought several new contributors. I was surprised to see so many people from all around the world [using my dashboards](https://github.com/search?q=dotdc%2Fgrafana-dashboards-kubernetes&type=code) in their home labs or in companies such as Rakuten, Orange, Swisscom, and Nokia. Some projects even directly embedded the dashboards, such as [Victoria Metrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack/hack/sync_grafana_dashboards.py#L48), the [GCP Cloud Foundation Fabric](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/tree/master/blueprints/gke/autopilot/bundle/monitoring/dashboards) and the [Microsoft Azure Arc Jumpstart](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/main/azure_jumpstart_ag/artifacts/monitoring/grafana-cluster-global.json).

Here are the current project statistics:

- ~5 million dashboards downloads ([grafana.com](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/?plcmt=top-nav&cta=downloads&search=dotdc) only!)
- 2293 GitHub stars
- 337 forks
- 26 contributors

## Changes

### General changes

Following community demand, the project now has proper [releases](https://github.com/dotdc/grafana-dashboards-kubernetes/releases) that are automatically generated using a semantic releaser, which leverages [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to create versions following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

Additionally, all dashboards now include a `cluster` variable support, which was implemented with a safe and straightforward solution as documented in [issue #15](https://github.com/dotdc/grafana-dashboards-kubernetes/issues/15).
This enables users of tools like [Thanos](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos), [Mimir](https://github.com/grafana/mimir), or any other federated or highly available setups to enjoy enhanced compatibility.

Furthermore, new panels have been added to visualize CPU throttling across all "views" dashboards.

### k8s-views-pods.json

Building on ideas from [issue #21](https://github.com/dotdc/grafana-dashboards-kubernetes/issues/21) and further work, k8s-views-pods.json has received a major update! Among the changes are several new information panels displaying priority class, QoS class, last terminated reason, and last terminated exit code.

Additionally, two new panels have been added: one compares CPU requests and limits to actual CPU usage, and the other does the same for memory. This helps to better visualize container resource usage and simplifies container sizing.

### k8s-addons-prometheus.json

The project now includes a dashboard for Prometheus with panels related to Prometheus instances, TSDB, query engine, resources, storage, and network.

### k8s-addons-trivy-operator.json

The k8s-addons-starboard-operator.json which used the Giant Swarm [starboard-exporter](https://github.com/giantswarm/starboard-exporter) has been replaced in favor of  k8s-addons-trivy-operator.json, based on metrics from the [trivy-operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) of Aqua Security.
